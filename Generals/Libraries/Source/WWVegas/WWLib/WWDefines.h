// Enable translation and rotation interpolation for raw animation (HRawAnimClass) updates.
// This was intentionally disabled in the retail version, but likely not fully thought through.
// Interpolation is certainly desired for animations that move and rotate meshes, but may not be
// desired for animations that teleport meshes from one location to another, such as blinking lights.
// @todo Implement a new flag per animation file to opt-out of interpolation.
